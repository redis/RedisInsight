# Contributing

Welcome! This short guide explains how to contribute effectively and pass all required checks.

## Submitting an issue

- If you find a bug, please submit an issue to our GitHub [repository](https://github.com/redis/RedisInsight/issues).
- Before submitting, search the issue tracker to see if your problem already exists. Existing issues may already have workarounds or ongoing fixes.

## Branch Naming Convention

Use lowercase, kebab-case, and a type prefix:

- `feature/<short-title>`
- `bugfix/<short-title>`

**Example**: `bugfix/fix-header-alignment`

_Note: It will trigger some CI, like unit tests and lint checks_

For frontend/backend only, prefix with `fe/` or `be/` to trigger fewer checks:

- `fe/feature/<short-title>`
- `be/bugfix/<short-title>`

**Example**: `be/bugfix/update-databases-api`

_Note: It will trigger only checks related to the back-end_

## Commits

- Keep commits small and focused.
- This makes it easier for reviewers to understand and track changes.
- Use meaningful commit messages (see [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) for inspiration).

## Pull Requests

Use the following procedure to submit a pull request:

1. Fork RedisInsight on GitHub (_[How to fork a repo?](https://docs.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/fork-a-repo)_)

2. Create a branch from `main` (see [Branch Naming](#branch-naming-convention))

```bash
git checkout -b bugfix/<short-title>
```

3. Make the changes and push to your branch (see [Commits](#commits))

```bash
git push bugfix/<short-title>
```

4. Initiate a pull request on GitHub (_[How to create a PR?](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request)_)

Try to provide as much descrtiption behind the context of your changes and how to verify them. Screenshorts and videos are always welcome ^\_^

5. Ensure tests are passing (_[see more](README.md#tests)_).

Done :)

By following these conventions, you help us keep RedisInsight stable, reliable, and easy to maintain. Thank you for contributing!
